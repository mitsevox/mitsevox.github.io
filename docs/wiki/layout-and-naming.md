# Layout & naming

Keep source readable, evidence discoverable and generated material disposable.

## Recommended layout

This is a starter convention. Preserve evidence-supported original source paths and an established project's structure instead of reorganizing working code to fit a template.

```text
game-slug/
  README.md
  CONTRIBUTING.md
  AGENTS.md
  CREDITS.md
  .gitignore
  src/                     # recovered and useful partial source
  include/                 # shared declarations
  config/
    README.md              # evidence and configuration conventions
    TARGET_ID/
      README.md            # target-specific mechanics
      baseline.json        # verified executable identity and geometry

```

File names above reflect NFL's pattern; their formats must be defined by the new project's tools. Creating an empty `units.json` does not make NFL's builder work on a different game. Optional contributor ledgers and history checkpoints belong in target configuration when the project's policy enables them.

## Naming rules

- **Original names:** preserve spelling and case when target evidence supports them. Keep the evidence locator.
- **Descriptive names:** make them readable, but mark them inferred rather than claiming the original name was recovered.
- **Unknown code/data:** retain stable neutral address labels. NFL uses `fn_XXXXXXXX` and `lbl_XXXXXXXX` with uppercase hexadecimal digits; these receive no named-function credit.
- **Files:** use recovered source paths when established. A descriptive filename can count as named while its original boundaries remain provisional.
- **Tools/docs:** use consistent repository conventions; Python tools commonly use `snake_case.py`, handbook pages use `kebab-case.md`.
- **Site assets:** use stable project slugs, for example `assets/covers/game-slug.webp`. Store display names separately from paths.

Do not invent a source-file split merely to produce a pretty map or increase file counts. Shared headers should have one accepted definition per type/address. Search existing declarations and current main before introducing another layout.

## Source and partial reconstruction

Useful incomplete functions stay in normal source files. Register their measured ranges separately. In NFL, an existing linked file can keep draft bodies behind the fixed `DECOMP_COMPARE` guard; promotion changes accepted placements and removes the guard, not the file location.

Keep source comments about intent, invariants and non-obvious relationships. Matching scores, compiler experiments, agent notes and review history belong in metadata or PR records. Unsupported field meanings stay unresolved; unaccessed regions stay opaque.

## Public and private material

Public Git should contain reviewed source, tools, curated evidence and bounded public reports. Keep original game binaries, generated objects, complete debug exports, private analysis databases and discarded trial variants out. A .gitignore entry does not remove a file already tracked; inspect the index before committing.

Do not copy absolute paths from another contributor's machine into shared configuration. Commands should accept a local reference path or use a documented owner-approved environment.

## Evidence format

NFL uses one claim per TSV row:

```text
kind  start  end  subject  origin  start_boundary  end_boundary  evidence
```

The separators are tabs. Addresses are hexadecimal and end-exclusive. Use `-` where unknown or inapplicable. Origins distinguish `target`, `signature`, `related` and `inferred`; boundaries independently distinguish `exact`, `provisional`, `open` and no claim. Use separate rows for a name, function extent, field layout and source-unit boundary—one claim must not silently prove another.

The [NFL evidence specification](https://github.com/mitsevox/nflstreet2/blob/d7a6f8e830baf4ac083dc52c2ad3e80cfbf13211/config/README.md) defines the full vocabulary. Adopt its schema intentionally and provide validators before relying on it in another repository.
